AML - Arduino Markup Language

# The project

AML is a new markup language for embedded system, simplifying the interaction between an arduino and a computer or a smartphone.
This repo contains the code for the embedded system, while two other repositories provide the interface for Chrome (AML-chromeapp) and Android (AML-android).
